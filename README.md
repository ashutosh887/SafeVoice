AI-Powered Legal Evidence Documentation for Victims of Abuse

SafeVoice is a voice-first AI companion that helps victims of domestic violence and abuse safely document incidents, preserve evidence, and prepare for legal action - without typing, legal knowledge, or exposing themselves to danger.

## 🚨 The Problem
Most abuse victims never report incidents.
Evidence is often lost due to fear, trauma, unsafe environments, and lack of legal guidance.
Written documentation can be discovered and used against them.

## 💡 The Solution
SafeVoice provides a private, secure space where victims can simply speak - and the system handles the rest.
