# SafeVoice
AI-Powered Legal Evidence Documentation for Victims of Abuse

SafeVoice is a voice-first AI companion designed to help victims of abuse safely document incidents, preserve evidence, and prepare for legal action — without typing, legal expertise, or putting themselves at risk.

The app is built with safety-first principles, including a decoy interface, PIN-protected access, and instant exit mechanisms, making it usable even in high-risk environments.

## The Problem

Most victims of abuse never report incidents.

Not because they do not want help — but because:
- Documenting evidence is unsafe
- Trauma makes writing and recall difficult
- Victims do not know what details are legally important
- Written journals can be discovered by an abuser
- Legal support is expensive and inaccessible

As a result, evidence is lost, escalation goes unnoticed, and victims remain trapped.

## The Solution

SafeVoice provides a private, secure space where victims can simply speak — and the system handles the rest.

It works quietly, looks harmless, and only reveals its real functionality when intentionally unlocked by the user.
